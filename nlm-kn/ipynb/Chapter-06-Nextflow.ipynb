    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The NCBI Cell pipeline calls for processing CELLxGENE data using\n",
    "NS-Forest, DEseq, and GOenrichment to produce marker, binary, and\n",
    "differentially-expressed genes and GO biological process (BP)\n",
    "enrichment information. Since use of Nextflow is planned for\n",
    "implementing these processing pipelines in a form that is platform\n",
    "agnostic and usable by researchers, the objectives of this document is\n",
    "to demonstrate how to\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use Nextflow to implement NS-Forest processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Nextflow is a workflow system for creating scalable, portable, and\n",
    "reproducible workflows. Based on the dataflow programming model,\n",
    "Nextflow deploys workflows on a variety of execution platforms,\n",
    "including your local machine, HPC schedulers, AWS Batch, Azure Batch,\n",
    "Google Cloud Batch, and Kubernetes, and supports Conda, Spack, Docker,\n",
    "Podman, Singularity, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section describes various development environments\n",

    "### Development environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Nextflow is distributed as a self-installing package, and can be used\n",
    "on any POSIX-compatible system (Linux, macOS, etc), and on Windows\n",
    "through WSL. It requires Bash 3.2 (or later) and Java 11 (or later, up\n",
    "to 22) to be installed. The Nextflow documentation provides the details.\n",

    "## Use Nextflow to implement NS-Forest processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Nextflow to implement NS-Forest processing, it is\n",
    "necessary to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create a module in the NSForest repository with the necessary\n",
    "    functions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Write a Docker file to create an image with the NSForest repository\n",
    "    and its dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Write Nextflow scripts to define processes and workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a module in the NSForest repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Module `nsforest.py` was created on branch\n",
    "`rl/deconstruct-nextflow-script` in fork `ralatsdc/NSForest` of\n",
    "`JCVenterInstitute/NSForest` to encapsulate the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `run_nsforest_with_preprocessing()`: Runs NSForest using the\n",
    "    specified dataset filepath, and `cluster_header`, including all\n",
    "    preprocessing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `downsample_adata_file()`: Calculates quality control metrics, and\n",
    "    sums total counts for each cell to downsample, if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `generate_scanpy_dendrogram()`: Generates a dendrogram of the\n",
    "    categories defined in grouping by `cluster_header`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `calculate_cluster_medians_per_gene()`: Calculates the median\n",
    "    expression matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `calculate_binary_scores_per_gene_per_cluster()`: Calculates the\n",
    "    binary scores of each gene per `cluster_header`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `run_nsforest_without_preprocessing()`: Performs the main NS-Forest\n",
    "    algorithm to find a list of markers for each `cluster_header`,\n",
    "    assuming all preprocessing steps were completed earlier\n",

    "\n",
    "### Write a Docker file\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dockerfile based on an image with Conda installed was created in\n",
    "repository `ralatsdc/nsforest-docker`. The base images uses the\n",
    "`.bashrc` startup file to initialize Conda and activate the Conda\n",
    "environment when running the image using Docker. However, Nextflow\n",
    "ignores this bash startup file, and so cannot activate the Conda\n",
    "environment using the `conda` process directive. As a result, the path\n",
    "to the `bin` directory of the Conda environment is added to `PATH` in\n",
    "the image. Finally, note that the repository contains a number of\n",
    "convenience scripts to build, push, and run the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "See: [ralatsdc/nsforest-docker/Dockerfile](https://github.com/ralatsdc/nsforest-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write Nextflow scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Three Nextflow scripts are included in\n",
    "`ralatsdc/springbok-ncbi-cell/ncbi-cell/nf`:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `nsforest-single-process.nf`: Calls function\n",
    "    `run_nsforest_with_preprocessing()` to process input CELLxGENE H5AD\n",
    "    files using NS-Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `nsforest-multiple-processes.nf`: Calls in order functions\n",
    "    `downsample_adata_file()`, `generate_scanpy_dendrogram()`,\n",
    "    `calculate_cluster_medians_per_gene()`,\n",
    "    `calculate_binary_scores_per_gene_per_cluster()`,\n",
    "    `run_nsforest_without_preprocessing()` to process input CELLxGENE\n",
    "    H5AD files using NS-Forest\n",

    "    then `run_nsforest_without_preprocessing()` to process input\n",
    "    CELLxGENE H5AD files using NS-Forest by cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripts are run at the command line in the\n",
    "`springbok-ncbi-cell/ncbi-cell/nf` directory using Nextflow. For\n",
    "example, run the single process script to print a help message as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nextflow run nsforest-single-process.nf --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the scripts implicitly use the `nextflow.config` file which\n",
    "enables Docker and specifies the container and its options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the multiple, over the single, process version\n",
    "centers around the flexibility of constructing alternative workflows,\n",
    "and leveraging Nextflow's ability to distribute the work load. Of\n",
    "course, the parallel process version reduces the time required to\n",
    "complete processing, which can be important for larger files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Docker is not required to run these Nextflow\n",
    "scripts. Provided that the path to `nsforest.py` has been added to the\n",
    "`PATH` environment variable, and a project virtual environment\n",
    "activated, then the single process script can be run without Docker\n",
    "using the `nextflow-without-docker.config` file as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nextflow run -c nextflow-without-docker.config nsforest-single-process.nf --h5adPath '../data/cellxgene-sample/*.H5AD'`\n",
    "\n",
    "If in the `nf` directory, the path to `nsforest.py` can be added to\n",
    "the `PATH` environment variable as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`export PATH=$PATH:$PWD`\n",
    "\n",
